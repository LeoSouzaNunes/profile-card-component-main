## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  I was able to apply some css properties such position relative and absolute to set the profile picture. I also learned that you can actually add as much background images as you want. 

### Continued development

  I intend to use React and styled components on my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [Multiple background-image](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This article was very useful to know that you can set more than one background image in an element.
